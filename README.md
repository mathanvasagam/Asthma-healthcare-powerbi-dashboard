# Asthma Executive Dashboard – Healthcare Analytics (Power BI)

## 📌 Project Overview
This project delivers a **professional, executive-level healthcare analytics dashboard** built using **Power BI**.  
The dashboard analyzes **asthma prevalence, disease control levels, and emergency room (ER) utilization** to support **data-driven clinical and operational decision-making**.

The solution is designed to mirror **real-world healthcare analytics dashboards** used by hospitals and public health teams.

---

## 🎯 Business Objective
Healthcare organizations need clear visibility into:
- Which demographic groups are most affected by asthma
- How well asthma is being controlled across populations
- What factors contribute to higher emergency room utilization

This project transforms raw patient data into **actionable insights** that help:
- Identify high-risk populations
- Monitor clinical control effectiveness
- Reduce avoidable ER visits and associated costs

---

## 🗂 Dataset Description
- **Type**: Synthetic healthcare dataset (anonymized)
- **Records**: 10,000 patient-level observations
- **Key Attributes**:
  - Demographics: Age, Gender, BMI
  - Environmental factors: Air Pollution Level, Smoking Status
  - Clinical metrics: FeNO Level, Peak Expiratory Flow (PEF)
  - Treatment behavior: Medication Adherence
  - Outcomes: Asthma Control Level, Number of ER Visits

> Note: The dataset is synthetic and used solely for analytical and educational purposes.

## 📊 Dashboard Features
- **Single-page Executive Dashboard**
- Dynamic **Age Group slicer** (Child, Adult, Middle Age, Senior)
- High-level KPIs:
  - Total Patients
  - Asthma Prevalence
  - Average Medication Adherence
- Analytical visuals:
  - Asthma cases by age group
  - Asthma control level distribution
  - ER visits vs medication adherence
  - Clinical severity analysis (FeNO vs Peak Expiratory Flow)

All visuals are **slicer-driven**, enabling real-time demographic and risk-based analysis without duplicating reports.

---

## 🧠 Key Insights
- Adults and seniors show higher asthma prevalence compared to children.
- Poor medication adherence is strongly associated with increased ER visits.
- Patients with poorly controlled asthma exhibit higher FeNO levels and reduced lung function.
- Environmental exposure (air pollution, smoking) contributes to asthma risk and severity.

## 🛠 Tools & Technologies
- **Power BI Desktop**
- **Power Query** – data cleaning and transformation
- **DAX** – KPI and metric calculations
- **GitHub** – version control and project documentation
